## `what_even_is_the_freaking_query`

Testing out a few alternate theories for what the perpendicular part of the query might be. Key results:

* Adding semantically similar tokens `"Mary"`, `"mary"` rather than just `" Mary"` doesn't seem to help
* Found weak evidence that there's some kind of "indirect prediction", because when you take the perpendicular component and put them through the MLPs it does favour IO over S1 (but the MLPs don't have much impact in IOI so this effect isn't large anyway)
