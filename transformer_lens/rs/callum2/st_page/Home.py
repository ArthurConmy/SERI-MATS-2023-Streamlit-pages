# Explore Prompts

This page was designed to help explore different prompts for GPT-2 Small, as part of my & Arthur Conmy's work on negative heads & copy suppression in transformers.

The goals of this page are:

* Help us keep track of our work in an accessible, readable way (rather than having everything dumped into messy notebooks and directories which we'll never return to),
* Provide a sandbox environment to help us spot interesting things about the behaviour of negative heads which we might otherwise have missed (e.g. their behaviour on bigrams),
* Make our work more accesible to others.
